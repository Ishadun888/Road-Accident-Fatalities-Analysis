# Road-Accident-Fatalities-Analysis
🚨 Road Accident Analysis - Tableau Assignment 3
This repository contains the Road Accident Analysis project developed using PowerBI to explore patterns, causes, safety measures, and emergency response trends associated with road accidents.

The objective is to derive actionable insights and visual storytelling from road accident data using interactive dashboards and visualizations to support policy-making and safety enhancements.

📌 Assignment Overview
The analysis includes the following major tasks:

Task 1: Handling Missing Values
Replacing N/A values in the “Helmet Used” column with "Unknown" to ensure data completeness.

Task 2: Road Accident Trends Over Time
Analyzing how accident occurrences have changed over time using line charts.

Task 3: Impact of Weather Conditions on Accidents
Heatmap visualization to study the effect of various weather conditions on accident frequencies.

Task 4: Compare Accidents with and without Safety Measures
Comparing fatality and injury rates based on seat belt and helmet usage.

Task 5: Fatality Rates by Road Type and Speeding
Using a Tree Map to visualize fatality rates by road type and analyze speeding as a factor.

Task 6: Emergency Response Time Analysis (Using Parameters)
Parameterized threshold to classify emergency responses into "Fast" or "Delayed" and analyze fatalities using bar charts.

Task 7: Road Accident Story
A complete Tableau Story presenting key findings, insights, and recommendations for decision-makers.
